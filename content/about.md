Hi :wave:, my name is Martin Kanters. I am a software engineer based in the Netherlands. 
I live in Utrecht together with my girlfriend Lisanne and my cat Moos.

As software engineer I work mostly as IT consultant for clients based in the financial domain. I enjoy working together with the client to make their service or product the best. I also strongly believe in Open Source Software. I think it is a great movement and I happily contribute to it. Since early 2020 I am an Apache Maven committer, and I have spent a lot of time on preparing the new major release (Maven 4).

Next to computers, I like other stuff as well! I enjoy playing the piano. Usually I play jazz music. Sometimes at home, sometimes at jam sessions in local pubs. I take my inspiration from Bill Evans, Kenny Barron and Oscar Peterson. You can also find me running, walking in nature, gaming or reading a book.
